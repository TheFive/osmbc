## Overview

Overview is intended to have a compact view on a blog. It does not display the blog text, but only the Title. 
If it is bilingual, the main column is the left one. Non closed comments are shown with a line at the left of the text.

You can go to the article editor with the "View" Hyperlink. With (Create / Edit / Translate) you go direct to the edit mode of the article.
* Create stands for the main markdown text is not written
* Translate stands for the left markdown text is not written
* Edit is the abbrevation for both text are already written and needs a change

Empy markdown of the main column is although in marked style.

Picture is shown in small.

## Translate

The translate view is similar to the overview.

Its main feature is, that in one column mode, it show all languages an article is already written in.

## Full

The full view is for editors, that like the complete text. Edit and View links are shown as Icon. Non closed comments are although shown.

## fullFinal

Fullfinal is intended to support review in OSMBC. There is no "Schnick Schnack", just the text, the picture and a very small edit link,
that direct opens the article editor, so that you can quickly fix any error.

It is not recommended to use this view in bilingual mode.

## Review

The Review is close to the full final view (some margins may differ), but it allows to edit an article in the view itself. To open the editor,
just click on an article. To save your changes, leave the editor, e.g. by clicking on the article again. As the click prevents using the hyperlink,
you have to use the right mouseclick to open a hyperlink and test its correctness.

## The languages

For every blog view you can choose the language in the upper right corner of OSMBC. Choose your language for the left side, and none or another language for the right side.
Some Views are not inteded to be bilingual, so not everything is shown in two columns.
